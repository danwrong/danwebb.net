If you’ve even been glancing at the startup/tech community you will not have missed Paul Graham's recent essay, [Founder Mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html), and the enormous amounts of surrounding commentary. It makes some sharp observations about the challenges founders face as their companies grow. It’s a great read and, of course, the problems are real but I fear the message to founders reads too much like: you are the founder, you know best, you must micromanage for victory. So, here’s my steaming hot take <a href="#founder-note1">*</a> - enjoy.

### Running a company is bloody hard, especially if it’s your first time

First, let’s put something pretty important out there: most founders have never led a large organization before. They’re learning on the job, often for the first time, with limited time and the stakes are HIGH. In an ideal world, the founder is able to communicate the company’s vision and goals perfectly, hire the right set of execs to enact that vision and be on exactly the same page as them so they make decisions perfectly in line with that vision.  That doesn’t happen - and this is the source of the pain that Paul Graham describes.

Leading at the org level requires skills that even veteran execs struggle with—things like clearly articulating vision and goals, giving feedback, performance management, and understanding the health of your organization but founders are thrown into these challenges mostly without prior experience. And, understandably, many of them feel imposter syndrome hard.

To compensate, they often hire experienced execs to fill the gaps. But here’s the catch: hiring senior leaders is a skill in itself, and one most founders haven’t mastered yet. Without the experience (or even time!) to assess candidates and onboard them in a way that aligns their goals with the founder’s vision—it’s easy for divergence to creep in. And let’s not ignore that your average seasoned exec’s strongest skill is often managing up.  You may have hired the greatest CMO in the world and they may confidently believe they are crushing it but if they’ve got a different idea of success you’re going to hit the rocks if you treat that part of the business as a black box. So is the answer to just roll your sleeves up and do it yourself? That’s tempting but how about another approach?

### Founder mode is about the details

For me, founder mode isn’t about addressing this pain by wrestling the controls out of your team's hands and going full micromanager. It’s about embracing the fact that you are the only one that truly understands your vision and, while you develop the skills to communicate that vision well, you are going to need to find ways to scale the company while keeping it rolling on a tactical level. 

It’s a balancing act.

**Trust your team** - If you micromanage and run a low-trust organization, your team will never surprise you—and this is not a good thing. They’ll stick rigidly to your instructions, fear going out on a limb and the company will stall because you’re the bottleneck for every decision. But if you trust your team, they’ll feel safe to experiment, innovate, and bring ideas you’d never think of. This is where your organization becomes more than the sum of its parts. Facebook’s early success came from [empowering many people](https://panmore.com/facebook-inc-organizational-culture-characteristics-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in the organisation to go ahead and ship - today, Meta still feels like a loosely knit collection of startups which is pretty impressive given its size and org complexity.

**…but never lose sight of the details** - Trust doesn’t mean you check out. As a founder, you need to stay deeply connected to the details. Talk to the people working directly with customers or building the product. Ask questions. Not to micromanage, but to understand. Feed what you learn back into the organization to sharpen how you communicate your vision and goals. You don’t need to do everyone’s job—you just need to understand enough about their challenges to lead effectively.

Vision and goals can often get abstract if you approach them from a top down perspective but can be viscerally highlighted by a founder’s detailed observations of operations on the ground.

A great example of this kind of leader is Will Shu, co-founder and CEO of Deliveroo. Even as the company scaled, Will kept himself grounded in the details. He delivered orders, took support calls, chatted with restaurant staff on busy nights, riders on the street, and engineers in the office. By staying connected, he was able to keep refining and communicating his vision, ensuring the whole team moved in the same direction.  However, fundamentally he trusted the team to deliver.

For instance, Will spending a night delivering orders would result in him chatting to our dispatch algorithms team and telling them about how our algorithm would send him up a giant hill but only give him 5 minutes to get to the restaurant before the food gets cold.  This kind of feedback highlighted ways the team can greatly improve the experience for riders and for the end customer but the team ultimately owned the solutions. <a href="#founder-note2">**</a>  There’s a [great interview with him here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5GhyBGyhK8LPuwdW4z40E2) where he discusses his approach.

So, in conclusion, I agree with Paul - founder mode should not be manager mode.  You have a unique viewpoint and role in the company - learn to use that wisely.  However, as your business grows, you’ll need to scale your team and a team that scales well is a team that has your trust, so don’t like founder mode mean micromanager mode - get down in the weeds and use that insight to keep your team on track and react quickly to challenges as they arise.

<span id="founder-note1"><strong>*</strong></span> I’m not a founder of a unicorn startup but I have worked with several. My word is not gospel but comes from what I believe is a valuable set of observations.  Read the following with that in mind.

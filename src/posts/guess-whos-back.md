I’ve had danwebb.net since 2000 and in the mid 2000s [my old blog](https://blog.danwebb.net) even got fairly popular amongst web developer types.  In fact, it was a factor in me getting hired by Twitter back in 2010.  Since then, like many early noughties personal blogs, it’s fallen silent as we all went to Twitter to shout into the void instead. This was all fun and games until the void started shouting back.

Fast forward to 2024 and I’ve been thinking the time is right to get it going again.  I’m lucky enough to have a pretty varied professional life at the moment where I spend equal amounts of time as a startup founder, a polyglot programmer (jack of all trades, master of none, if I’m honest) and a technical leader.  I’ve learnt from some amazing people, I’ve made some mistakes and learned from them and I’ve seen a [whole load of crazy](https://x.com/siggy/status/236641738406625281?lang=en-GB) tech industry shit.  This all adds up to a certain amount of wisdom/entertaining anecdotes.

Alongside building [Existent](https://existent.com) and its team, I spend quite a bit of time advising startups who want to build outstanding engineering teams sometimes as an angel investor, sometimes for friends and sometimes as an independent advisor.  It’s becoming clear to me that I repeat myself quite frequently so I’ve decided to commit some of this stuff to Markdown in the hope that someone might find it useful, at the very least, it’ll be useful to me.

So, the plan is, I’m going to write some bite size posts here on this blog and cross post them to Linkedin.  There’s gonna be a lot of tech leadership, a little bit of technical stuff and a smidgen of startup waffle.  If you like it, either follow me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-webb-04b562/) or [grab the feed](/feed.xml) and put it in your retro hipster feed reader of choice.

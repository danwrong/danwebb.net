<img src="/img/me.png" class="bio-pic">

I'm a [experienced engineering leader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-webb-04b562/) having spent the majority of my career in fast scaling engineering teams from Twitter to Deliveroo to Meta Reality Labs and on to founding my own startup, Existent. 

I know what small and scrappy looks like, having founded my own startup and building the team and culture from scratch but I also know what mature teams look like having led engineering teams through preparing for an IPO.  Most importantly, I've got a good sense for how organisations need to evolve over time.  

I've done a lot of things, dealt with many of the challenges that come with scaling a startup and have learned from many mistakes.  Recently, I've been enjoying working as an advisor and coach to several exciting UK startups including [Apron](https://getapron.com/), [Plain](http://plain.com) and [9Fin](https://9fin.com/) and I love it - it's great to learn about every startups unique challenges and help make them successful.  

### Ways I can help

* __Coach your engineering leadership:__ If your leaders are up to the challenge of scaling with your team but would appreciate someone as a sounding board or second opinion I can help with regular catch ups or deep dives on particular topics.

* __Hiring engineering leadership__: If you're looking for an experienced leader to grow your organisation (such as a CTO, VPE or head of engineering) I can help throughout the hiring process from building a job description to working with your recruiters to tune sourcing through to designing interviews and conducting interview training.  I'll help you have confidence you are finding the right person for the role.

* __Technical due dilligence__: If you are an investor looking to assess a startup's engineering capability or a startup raising and preparing for DD, I can help you be successful.

If you are scaling an engineering team in a fast growing startup and would appreciate some support, [we should talk](mailto:dan@danwebb.net).
